This repository demonstrates a common but often overlooked issue in Dockerfiles: using non-specific base images and neglecting security best practices. The original Dockerfile uses `ubuntu:latest`, which changes over time, leading to unpredictable build results and potential incompatibilities.  It also fails to specify a dedicated user, creating a significant security vulnerability. This improved version addresses these problems by using a specific version of Ubuntu, using a dedicated user and optimizing the `apt-get` commands for better efficiency and security.
